 Project Title: Snake Game
 Language: Java

Game Window:
  •	Dimensions: 600 x 400 pixels
  •	Background Color: Black
  •	Snake Color: Green
  •	Food Color: Red

Game Mechanics:
  •	Snake, Food, Movement & Game Loop.
Game Logic:
  •	Initialization:
  •	Snake starts with one segment at position (5, 5).
  •	Food is spawned at a random location.
  
Movement:
  •	Snake moves in the current direction, with the head moving forward and the tail following.
  
Collision Detection:
  •	Checks for collisions with walls and self.
  •	Game ends if the snake collides with itself or the boundaries.
  
Food Consumption:
  •If the snake's head reaches the food, the food is consumed, and a new food item is spawned.
  •	The snake grows in size when food is consumed.
  
User Interaction:
  •	Controls: Arrow keys to change the snake's direction.
  •	Game Over: Displays "Game Over" message when the game ends.
  
Future Enhancements:
  • Add scoring system to track points.
  • Implement levels with increasing difficulty.
  • Include sound effects for food consumption and game over.

Conclusion:
This Java Snake Game project demonstrates fundamental programming concepts such as object-oriented design, 
event handling, and basic game mechanics, providing a fun and interactive experience.
